# GAME OF THRONES CHEAT SHEET

## Description
The goal of this project was to use the full stack of web development technologies to create an app that would showcase our ability to use the principles we've learned in class in a collaborative setting. We were tasked with using the MVC model for a website that would allow users to retrieve and add information, rendered dynamically through Handlebars, and fulfill a novel purpose for that user. Our group decided to use our shared interest in the Game of Thrones books and TV series to create a resource for users to be able to learn more about the show and add to their knowledge base online. We believe we tackled the challenge with a positive collaborative spirit and pulled out all the stops to create the best app we could. It was a very fruitful experience that will carry us into our final project for the class.
